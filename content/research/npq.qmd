Part of a broader funded project entitled "Mapping photosynthetic quantum yield in the coastal ocean," this work investigated a physiological phenomonon in marine phytoplankton called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), a means by which phytoplankton protect themselves from too much sunlight. Think natural sunscreen.

The project involved twelve week-long cruises (one per month) along the mid-Atlantic bight from Delaware Bay north along the New Jersey coast. Carried out on the Universitiy of Delaware's [UNOLS](https://www.unols.org/){target="_blank"} research vessel [R/V *Hugh R. Sharp*](https://www.udel.edu/content/dam/udelImages/ceoe/documents/marine-operations/rvSharp-Overview-Jan-2018_long.pdf){target="_blank"}, we sampled continuously for phytoplankton maximum quantum yield using a Fluorescence Induction and Relaxation (FIRe) system, ocean particle size distribution and counts using a Coulter Counter, surface nutrients using a Submersible Ultraviolet Nitrate Analyzer (SUNA), solar irradiance, sea surface temperature, and surface salinity.
