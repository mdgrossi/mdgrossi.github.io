This project was the continuation of a series of summer undergraduate Marine Field Projects courses at Florida Tech. A key element of these courses involved students planning and executing a multidisciplinary 4-day/3-night research cruise aboard the R/V *Gulf Stream Eagle*, complete with a comprehensive research proposal, science objectives, and cruise plans. After the completion of the course, I worked with Mr. Michael Splitt, Assistant Professor of Meteorology, to further develop the cruise oceanography project.

The project involved using *in situ* ocean temperature, salinity, and current speed and direction data collected on a June 2007 cruise in the vacinity of the western boundary of the Gulf Stream to validate the Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (RTOFS) for the nearshore Atlantic coastal waters of southeast Florida. We compared RTOFS forecasts to these data and to buoy data from the NOAA [National Data Buoy Center](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/){target="_blank"} (NDBC). Insights from these comparisons provided a basis for spatial and temporal bias evaluation of RTOFS during Fall 2007.
