This evolved from a series of class projects in an Ocean Atmosphere Dynamcs class taught by Dr. Avijit Gangopadhyay at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in 2015. Student mini-reports were compiled into the first of what we envisioned to be a series of Technical Reports providing short overviews of all known climate patterns.

Additional research and outreach avenues are currently pending funding.
