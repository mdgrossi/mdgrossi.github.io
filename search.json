    "text": "About the Instrument\nArgo floats are autonomous instruments that float around in the ocean while collecting measurements of temperature and salinity at different depths in the water column, called profiles. They are essentially gliders without wings. The float sinks from the surface to depths down to 2000 meters (though some newer models can go even deeper), measuring temperature, salinity, and sometimes other ocean properties as they go. They then drift at depth for a few days before ascending to the surface (again measuring as they go) where they make a satellite phone call to send their data back to land. Dive, drift, ascend, call home, repeat.\nArgo floats have been in operation throughout the open ocean since the late 1990s and have provided over one million profiles during this time. Before these floats the only way to get such measurements was with ships, scientists, and lots of money."

    "text": "About the Instrument\nHigh-frequency (HF) radar measures coastal surface currents by utilizing the Doppler Effect, the same way that the police monitor one’s speed on the highway. A coastal ocean dynamics application radar (CODAR) unit consists of a signal transmitter, a receiver, one or two antennae, and a computer to operate the system and process the incoming data. The transmitter emits a radio pulse, which travels out over the water before being reflected back by waves. The reflected signal is received by the unit and, using the time delay and the known information about the wave field (period and frequency), the underlying surface current can be estimated.\nBy pairing two or more nearby units with overlapping spatial coverage, the current direction can also be estimated using basic trigonometry and hourly maps of surface currents can be generated. Data such as these have any applications. The United States Coast Guard, for example, relies heavily on these maps when strategizing search and rescue operations."

During my tenure at SMAST, I overhauled and upgraded a unit that had been problematic for many years and had been completely offline for several months prior to my arrival. Two other notoriously problematic sites were also repaired and the fourth site upgraded in order to make OCEANOL’s northern site completely operational and reliable once again, which was necessary for MARACOOS to maintain and surpass its operational goal of having 80% of all of its units running 80% of the time.\nWhen the CODAR program director expressed an interest in extending the network beyond the existing northernmost site in lower Cape Cod, I coordinated with our contact at the National Parks Service to identify possible new locations along the Cape Cod National Seashore that met the technical criteria. We performed a series of tests using a temporary set up at a couple of identified locales. Today, the Cape Cod network extends to Provincetown, MA."

An important part of the scientific endeavor was to develop a new compact and biodegradable drifter that can be easily deployed in large quantities with a minimal environmental footprint.

In one of the largest coordinated drifter deployments ever conducted, we strategically deployed, recovered, and redeployed 500 of these drifters several times over the course of 3-4 weeks and ended up with more than 2.3 million drifter data points from this experiment alone. This added to similar quantities of data from previous field campaigns, bringing the total up to roughly 19 million data points.\nMy doctoral dissertation project stemmed from the reality that it is impossible for a team of scientists, let alone an individual graduate student, to manually process and analyze such large quantities of data efficiently and in the short time windows (usually a few years at a time) in which research operates. Following the lead of successful, well-known companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google that process enormous – and ever increasing – quantities of user data in near real time using machine learning and artificial intelligence, I explored the use of machine learning for analyzing ocean data.\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence is surprisingly new for ocean scientists because these methods requiring having lots of data. Up until very recently, oceanographers simply did not have enough data available to them. The CARTHE drifter data presented an exciting opportunity to test new data-driven modeling techniques on oceanographic problems. My dissertation research did just that."

    "text": "Photo by Conor Sexton on Unsplash.\n\n\n\nThe motion of the ocean is chaotic, making it impossible to predict perfectly. This is especially true on time scales of hours to days and space scales less than 10 km. Oceanic motions on these scales are characterized as submesoscale and are strongly influenced by vertical motion. The ability to predict submesoscale motion is critical for forecasting the transport of material such as spilled oil, debris, or harmful algal blooms. Yet observing them is difficult because they are not detectable by the vast majority of satellite platforms circling the planet every day, and modeling them accurately with general ocean circulation models (OGCMs) or statistical models requires far finer grid resolution than is humanly or computationally possible. (To capture all ocean dynamics faithfully, one would need to calculate – or sample – velocity at an estimated 1023 spatial points simultaneously over many time steps, while the highest resolution OGCM on the largest state-of-the-art supercomputer calculates velocity at only 109 spatial points at any given time – and is extremely expensive to run.)\nModern data driven methods such as machine learning (ML) are built upon the rationale that cause and effect relationships often exist between relevant variables and observed outcomes. Any sailor or mariner, for example, is keenly aware of the relationship between wind speed and sea state. ML models “learn” statistical relationships between available data variables and then use that information to make predictions about new cases not seen during training, often with remarkable accuracy that exceeds human skill or traditional forecasting methods. And while training ML models requires considerable time and computational resources, once trained, they can easily be run in a matter of seconds or minutes.\nInspired by the success of ML in a multitude of other fields as well as its growing popularity in oceanography, this project explored whether observational ocean data, while sparse, contain enough information to train a ML model to predict surface transport. The project had several goals: first, determining the level of complexity of oceanic flows that simple ML algorithms – namely, artificial or feed-forward neural networks – could be trained to learn, and how their performance compared to more traditional statistical methods. This involved simulated and modeled particle trajectories. Next, we explored the degree to which these simple models could also learn to predict real observed trajectories using data from hundreds of surface drifters deployed in the northern Gulf of Mexico as part of the Grand Lagrangian Experiment in 2012. Finally, we considered whether more adanced ML models can improve predictive performance by incorporating physics-based intuition.\n\n Awards\n\nUniversity of Miami Center for Computational Science Graduate Fellow (supported cross-department interdisciplinary research; 2017)\nGulf of Mexico Research Institute (GoMRI) Scholar (also featured a project write-up by the funding agency; 2019)\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nGrossi, M.D., M.

    "text": "“Why is the orange going in that direction?”\nMy interest in oceanography can be traced back to middle school, to a simple eighth grade experiment1 measuring the tidal current through the Cape Cod Canal in Bourne, MA. With stopwatch in hand, my classmates and I tossed an orange into the water and waited some distance away for the fruit to float by.\nBut hailing from a small Connecticut town 50 miles from the ocean, we had no idea that the howling spring wind could make the water appear to be flowing in the direction opposite of the strong tidal flow. To our surprise, the orange did not drift the direction we expected it to that day. (Thank goodness for the scientific method and triplicate replications!) Two decades later, I am still passionate about ocean science and driven by that relentless curiousity that propels scientists. I also still throw things into the water in the name of science, although nowadays they are much fancier and more expensive than citrus fruit.\n\n“Why is the orange going in that direction?” \n\n\n\n\nMy career started at the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, FL where I majored in oceanography with a concentration in physical oceanography. Not more than two weeks after settling into my new residence hall room, we got hit by the first of what would be several major hurricanes of a record-breaking season. Being stuck on campus during the storm was not a particularly pleasant experience, to say the least, but it did instill in me an appreciation of how intricately connected the ocean and atmosphere systems really are.\nI also found myself, as an undergraduate, awed by the summer afternoon thunderstorms that characterize Florida’s rainy season. Never before had I been able to observe thunderstorms so clearly from a distance or actually watch cumulonimbus clouds develop under summer convection. In Connecticut, hills and trees obstruct the view of the sky, and the occasional thunderstorms we did receive were usually associated with cold fronts. Experiencing these daily thunderstorms and, paradoxically, the unfortunate situation of being a college freshmen stuck for a week in a 190-square-foot interior dorm room with neither windows nor air conditioning and only a “survival” lunch bag of food from the dining hall inspired me to also minor in meteorology at Florida Tech.\nI went on to earn a Master’s in marine studies with a concentration in oceanography from the University of Delaware in lovely Lewes, DE. I was priviledged to work for and with Dr. Matt Oliver in his newly formed Ocean Exploration, Remote Sensing, and Biogeography (ORB) Lab. In addition to taking classes, conducting research, and writing a thesis, Matt mentored us to utilize our time in school to develop technical skills because, he explained, “Courses and theses don’t get people jobs. Skills do. And you never know what skill set will land you a job.” This meant going to sea – a lot: one week-long research cruise every month for a year. It meant learning how to use oceanographic instruments such as buoyancy-driven underwater gliders and how to write computer code in R. It meant helping inaugurate a Global Visualization Lab and using it for outreach to more than a thousand outside visitors including school kids, local residents, tourists, and elected officials. And it meant attending glider school to be trained in how to prepare, deploy, pilot, and recover autonomous underwater vehicles. Little did I know that this last skill, though unrelated to my thesis research, would later land me my first job.\n\n“You never know what skill set will land you a job.” ~Matt Oliver\n\nThat first job was in the Ocean Observation Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth School for Marine Science and Technology. I was the northern regional technician for the NOAA IOOS Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System (MARACOOS) responsible for maintaining and operating high-frequency radar sites for measuring ocean currents and an ocean glider for coastal observation.

    "text": "“Why is the orange going in that direction?”\nMy interest in oceanography can be traced back to middle school, to a simple eighth grade experiment1 measuring the tidal current through the Cape Cod Canal in Bourne, MA. With stopwatch in hand, my classmates and I tossed an orange into the water and waited some distance away for the fruit to float by.\nBut hailing from a small Connecticut town 50 miles from the ocean, we had no idea that the howling spring wind could make the water appear to be flowing in the direction opposite of the strong tidal flow. To our surprise, the orange did not drift the direction we expected it to that day. (Thank goodness for the scientific method and triplicate replications!) Two decades later, I am still passionate about ocean science and driven by that relentless curiousity that propels scientists. I also still throw things into the water in the name of science, although nowadays they are much fancier and more expensive than citrus fruit.\n\n“Why is the orange going in that direction?” \n\n\n\n\nMy career started at the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, FL where I majored in oceanography with a concentration in physical oceanography. Not more than two weeks after settling into my new residence hall room, we got hit by the first of what would be several major hurricanes of a record-breaking season. Being stuck on campus during the storm was not a particularly pleasant experience, to say the least, but it did instill in me an appreciation of how intricately connected the ocean and atmosphere systems really are.\nI also found myself, as an undergraduate, awed by the summer afternoon thunderstorms that characterize Florida’s rainy season. Never before had I been able to observe thunderstorms so clearly from a distance or actually watch cumulonimbus clouds develop under summer convection. In Connecticut, hills and trees obstruct the view of the sky, and the occasional thunderstorms we did receive were usually associated with cold fronts. Experiencing these daily thunderstorms and, paradoxically, the unfortunate situation of being a college freshmen stuck for a week in a 190-square-foot interior dorm room with neither windows nor air conditioning and only a “survival” lunch bag of food from the dining hall inspired me to also minor in meteorology at Florida Tech.\nI went on to earn a Master’s in marine studies with a concentration in oceanography from the University of Delaware in lovely Lewes, DE. I was priviledged to work for and with Dr. Matt Oliver in his newly formed Ocean Exploration, Remote Sensing, and Biogeography (ORB) Lab. In addition to taking classes, conducting research, and writing a thesis, Matt mentored us to utilize our time in school to develop technical skills because, he explained, “Courses and theses don’t get people jobs. Skills do. And you never know what skill set will land you a job.” This meant going to sea – a lot: one week-long research cruise every month for a year. It meant learning how to use oceanographic instruments such as buoyancy-driven underwater gliders and how to write computer code in R. It meant helping inaugurate a Global Visualization Lab and using it for outreach to more than a thousand outside visitors including school kids, local residents, tourists, and elected officials. And it meant attending glider school to be trained in how to prepare, deploy, pilot, and recover autonomous underwater vehicles. Little did I know that this last skill, though unrelated to my thesis research, would later land me my first job.\n\n“You never know what skill set will land you a job.” ~Matt Oliver\n\nThat first job was in the Ocean Observation Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth School for Marine Science and Technology. I was the northern regional technician for the NOAA IOOS Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System (MARACOOS) responsible for maintaining and operating high-frequency radar sites for measuring ocean currents and an ocean glider for coastal observation. I prepped, deployed (i.e., threw in the water), and recovered the glider on science missions off southern New England and retreived and pre-processed data upon returning to the lab.\nSeveral years later I returned to school to pursue a Ph.D. in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.

(Generative AI is great, but don’t let it replace your human skills.) Persevere and be passionate. Anyone can become a scientist. And anyone can become an oceanographer. You don’t have to grow up in a big city along the water. I certainly did not.\n\n\nCollege/university\nLearn how to write computer code. It doesn’t matter what language. Take a class if you can, even if it’s not required for your major, and practice, practice, practice! Your academic and (very likely) your professional career will be exponentially better off.\n\n\nUndergraduate and graduate school\nTake advantage of any opportunity that comes your way – and don’t be bashful about seeking out opportunities, either. Volunteer in a lab. Help with field work. Go on a cruise – a research cruise, preferably! And perhaps more importantly, embrace opportunities to learn new skills and get trained in new techniques, even if applicability isn’t immediately obvious – because you never know what skill set will land you a job."

Ships are slow and expensive, human scientists get tired and sea sick, and the ocean is, well, rather large. Several thousand autonomous Argo profiling floats deployed all over the world since the late 1990s have provided unparalleled glimpses below the surface into the deep ocean. Yet compared to the size of the ocean, even these data remain sparse.\nOn the other hand, satellites orbiting the planet several times a day are able to measure properties such as ocean temperature in considerably higher spatial and temporal resolution. But satellites are optical instruments, meaning they can only “see” as far down into the water column as light can penetrate. In most of the ocean, this is not very far – a few meters at best, as shown in the photo above. The average depth of the ocean, in contrast, is around 4 kilometers or 4000 meters.\nThe goal of this project was to develop a way of predicting sparsely sampled subsurface structure using higher resolution satellite data.\n\nPosters and Presentations\n\nGrossi, M.D., E.F.

    "text": "About the Instrument\nSomewhat paradoxically, much of what we know about the world’s ocean comes from observations made from space. The advent of satellite remote sensing – named because the Earth is sensed remotely, as opposed to directly, from satellites orbiting the planet – have given oceanographers unprecedented amounts of information. From their vantage point far above the Earth’s surface, satellites can “see” wide spatial areas at a time, and because of the speed at which they must move in order to maintain orbit, they often able to sense the entire planet every day.\nMany ocean properties are routinely observed from space. Among them are water temperature, sea surface height, ocean color (a proxy for productivity), and salinity.\nThe most significant limitation of remote sensing platforms is that they are only “see” a thin layer of the ocean. This is because they are optical instruments, which means they can only see as far as light penetrates below the surface. As any diver will attest to, in most of the ocean, this is only a few meters at best. Meanwhile, the average ocean depth is 4 kilometers, or 4000 meters. Despite this limitation, satellites are among the most popular sources of ocean information and arguably produce more data than any other ocean platform."

Generally the sensors are attached to a rosette (shown above, though surrounded by Niskin water sampling bottles) which is lowered into the ocean from a ship. It’s amazing how much physical oceanography – and biological and chemical oceanography as well – can be learned from these three simple measurements."

Because they are mounted through the hull of the glider, one must either carefully remove the instrument, thereby jeopardizing the water seal, or else ship the entire glider out, which is obviously very expensive if not altogether impractical.\nThe Ocean Observation Laboratory in which I worked engineered a rig that attaches an external CTD cage to the side of a glider. This CTD was factory calibrated regularly and was assumed to provide the truth. We then developed a method of taking simultaneous CTD measurements with this CTD and the glider CTD in a saltwater acoustic test tank. We carried out this procedure immediately before and after every glider deployment and the discrepancies between these two sets of measurements were used to adjust the glider observations during post-mission data processing."

Of course, robots are intended to make human lives easier or to carry out tasks that are altogether impossible for humans to accomplish. Underwater robots go where humans cannot, cost a fraction of what it costs to send humans to sea, and take measurements much faster than humans can. Unlike human scientists, underwater robots do not need to stop to eat, do not need to sleep, and do not get seasick!\nPictured above is a low-powered Slocum electric autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). It “glides” through the water column in a saw-tooth pattern without any artificial propulsion. It dives by drawing water into the nose, thereby decreasing its buoyancy, and its wings provide it forward momentum. (Without the wings it would sink straight down, like Argo floats.) To resurface, it simply increases its buoyancy by extracting the water. It moves at a whopping speed of less than 1 mph and can remain at sea between 30 and 90 days, depending on the type of batteries onboard.\nThese gliders can be thought of as oceanographic pickup trucks: the glider itself is merely a vehicle that carries an assortment of sensors with it. The baseline model contains a CTD, fluorometer for measuring light backscatter, and a dissolved oxygen sensor, but a glider can be outfitted with any number of additional sensors provided they are small enough, light enough, and can operate on low power."

I have since completed two other trainings at Rutgers University Center for Ocean Observing Leadership. At the University of Massachusetts School for Marine Science and Technology (SMAST), I was responsible for overseeing the maintenance and operation of the Ocean Observation Laboratory’s (OCEANOL) glider named Blue (after blue whales). This involved carefully ballasting the glider before missions, conducting pre-mission inspections and testing, mission planning, deployment, mission monitoring, recovery, post-mission technical debriefings, and data preprocessing.\nDuring my tenure at SMAST, OCEANOL exceeded its operational goal of one 30-day glider mission per 12-month period for the first time since acquiring the glider. This demonstrated a matured dependability as a MARACOOS participant and put the lab in a position to work on establishing the technical infrastructure for piloting the glider in-house. On the third successful mission I trained a new lab technician who took over when I returned to graduate school. Blue would soon complete its first three-month mission a few months later.\nGiven the interest in the glider by nearly every visiting group, I created a fact sheet to answer many frequently asked questions in the event I was not able to provide an in-person demonstration or if Blue was at sea. I also programmed a demonstration mission that made the glider dive and resurface once in the School’s 90,000 gallon optics and acoustics test tank, a feat that was not nearly as easy to accomplish as I had hoped, given the size of the tank. Throughout all of this, I carefully documented my methods, best practices, and recommendations for glider operations in a number of internal technical reports in order to ensure a smooth transfer of knowledge."
