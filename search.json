    "text": "Photo by Conor Sexton on Unsplash.\n\n\n\nThe motion of the ocean is chaotic, making it impossible to predict perfectly. This is especially true on time scales of hours to days and space scales less than 10 km. Oceanic motions on these scales are characterized as submesoscale and are strongly influenced by vertical motion. The ability to predict submesoscale motion is critical for forecasting the transport of material such as spilled oil, debris, or harmful algal blooms. Yet observing them is difficult because they are not detectable by the vast majority of satellite platforms circling the planet every day, and modeling them accurately with general ocean circulation models (OGCMs) or statistical models requires far finer grid resolution than is humanly or computationally possible. (To capture all ocean dynamics faithfully, one would need to calculate – or sample – velocity at an estimated 1023 spatial points simultaneously over many time steps, while the highest resolution OGCM on the largest state-of-the-art supercomputer calculates velocity at only 109 spatial points at any given time – and is extremely expensive to run.)\nModern data driven methods such as machine learning (ML) are built upon the rationale that cause and effect relationships often exist between relevant variables and observed outcomes. Any sailor or mariner, for example, is keenly aware of the relationship between wind speed and sea state. ML models “learn” statistical relationships between available data variables and then use that information to make predictions about new cases not seen during training, often with remarkable accuracy that exceeds human skill or traditional forecasting methods. And while training ML models requires considerable time and computational resources, once trained, they can easily be run in a matter of seconds or minutes.\nInspired by the success of ML in a multitude of other fields as well as its growing popularity in oceanography, this project explored whether observational ocean data, while sparse, contain enough information to train a ML model to predict surface transport. The project had several goals: first, determining the level of complexity of oceanic flows that simple ML algorithms – namely, artificial or feed-forward neural networks – could be trained to learn, and how their performance compared to more traditional statistical methods. This involved simulated and modeled particle trajectories. Next, we explored the degree to which these simple models could also learn to predict real observed trajectories using data from hundreds of surface drifters deployed in the northern Gulf of Mexico as part of the Grand Lagrangian Experiment in 2012. Finally, we considered whether more adanced ML models can improve predictive performance by incorporating physics-based intuition.\n\n Awards\n\nUniversity of Miami Center for Computational Science Graduate Fellow (supported cross-department interdisciplinary research; 2017)\nGulf of Mexico Research Institute (GoMRI) Scholar (also featured a project write-up by the funding agency; 2019)\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nGrossi, M.D., M.

    "text": "“Why is the orange going in that direction?”\nMy interest in oceanography can be traced back to middle school, to a simple eighth grade experiment1 measuring the tidal current through the Cape Cod Canal in Bourne, MA. With stopwatch in hand, my classmates and I tossed an orange into the water and waited some distance away for the fruit to float by.\nBut hailing from a small Connecticut town 50 miles from the ocean, we had no idea that the howling spring wind could make the water appear to be flowing in the direction opposite of the strong tidal flow. To our surprise, the orange did not drift the direction we expected it to that day. (Thank goodness for the scientific method and triplicate replications!) Two decades later, I am still passionate about ocean science and driven by that relentless curiousity that propels scientists. I also still throw things into the water in the name of science, although nowadays they are much fancier and more expensive than citrus fruit.\n\n“Why is the orange going in that direction?” \n\n\n\n\nMy career started at the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, FL where I majored in oceanography with a concentration in physical oceanography. Not more than two weeks after settling into my new residence hall room, we got hit by the first of what would be several major hurricanes of a record-breaking season. Being stuck on campus during the storm was not a particularly pleasant experience, to say the least, but it did instill in me an appreciation of how intricately connected the ocean and atmosphere systems really are.\nI also found myself, as an undergraduate, awed by the summer afternoon thunderstorms that characterize Florida’s rainy season. Never before had I been able to observe thunderstorms so clearly from a distance or actually watch cumulonimbus clouds develop under summer convection. In Connecticut, hills and trees obstruct the view of the sky, and the occasional thunderstorms we did receive were usually associated with cold fronts. Experiencing these daily thunderstorms and, paradoxically, the unfortunate situation of being a college freshmen stuck for a week in a 190-square-foot interior dorm room with neither windows nor air conditioning and only a “survival” lunch bag of food from the dining hall inspired me to also minor in meteorology at Florida Tech.\nI went on to earn a Master’s in marine studies with a concentration in oceanography from the University of Delaware in lovely Lewes, DE. I was priviledged to work for and with Dr. Matt Oliver in his newly formed Ocean Exploration, Remote Sensing, and Biogeography (ORB) Lab. In addition to taking classes, conducting research, and writing a thesis, Matt mentored us to utilize our time in school to develop technical skills because, he explained, “Courses and theses don’t get people jobs. Skills do. And you never know what skill set will land you a job.” This meant going to sea – a lot: one week-long research cruise every month for a year. It meant learning how to use oceanographic instruments such as buoyancy-driven underwater gliders and how to write computer code in R. It meant helping inaugurate a Global Visualization Lab and using it for outreach to more than a thousand outside visitors including school kids, local residents, tourists, and elected officials. And it meant attending glider school to be trained in how to prepare, deploy, pilot, and recover autonomous underwater vehicles. Little did I know that this last skill, though unrelated to my thesis research, would later land me my first job.\n\n“You never know what skill set will land you a job.” ~Matt Oliver\n\nThat first job was in the Ocean Observation Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth School for Marine Science and Technology. I was the northern regional technician for the NOAA IOOS Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System (MARACOOS) responsible for maintaining and operating high-frequency radar sites for measuring ocean currents and an ocean glider for coastal observation. I prepped, deployed (i.e., threw in the water), and recovered the glider on science missions off southern New England and retreived and pre-processed data upon returning to the lab.\nSeveral years later I returned to school to pursue a Ph.D. in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. This flagship program nicely tied together my interests in both marine and atmospheric science. Under the direction of Dr. Tamay Özgökmen, I participated in and was funded by the Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment, a team of dozens of top scientists and researchers from around the world seeking to better understand the fate of the oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

You don’t have to grow up in a big city along the water. I certainly did not.\n\n\nCollege/university\nLearn how to write computer code. It doesn’t matter what language. Take a class if you can, even if it’s not required for your major, and practice, practice, practice! Your academic and (very likely) your professional career will be exponentially better off.\n\n\nUndergraduate and graduate school\nTake advantage of any opportunity that comes your way – and don’t be bashful about seeking out opportunities, either. Volunteer in a lab. Help with field work. Go on a cruise – a research cruise, preferably! And perhaps more importantly, embrace opportunities to learn new skills and get trained in new techniques, even if applicability isn’t immediately obvious – because you never know what skill set will land you a job."

    "text": "R/V Gulf Stream Eagle. Photo of by E. Gonzalez.\n\n\n\nThis project was the continuation of a series of summer undergraduate Marine Field Projects courses at Florida Tech. A key element of these courses involved students planning and executing a multidisciplinary 4-day/3-night research cruise aboard the R/V Gulf Stream Eagle, complete with a comprehensive research proposal, science objectives, and cruise plans. After the completion of the course, I worked with Mr. Michael Splitt, Assistant Professor of Meteorology, to further develop the cruise oceanography project.\nThe project involved using in situ ocean temperature, salinity, and current speed and direction data collected on a June 2007 cruise in the vacinity of the western boundary of the Gulf Stream to validate the Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (RTOFS) for the nearshore Atlantic coastal waters of southeast Florida. We compared RTOFS forecasts to these data and to buoy data from the NOAA National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). Insights from these comparisons provided a basis for spatial and temporal bias evaluation of RTOFS during Fall 2007.\n\nPosters and Presentations\n\nGrossi, M.D. (2007) Evaluation of the Real-Time Ocean Forecast System in Florida Atlantic Coastal Waters, Florida Institute of Technology Department of Maine & Environmental Systems Summer Symposium, Melbourne, FL.

    "text": "Screenshot of automatic species detection and classification in action, with bounding boxes showing fish found within the image and label indicating the most probable species name and uncertainty. Image courtesy of J. Prior.\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) research and development has rapidly accelerated in recent years throughout NOAA. At the NOAA Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC), innovative ML-based automations have been developed for ageing fish (e.g., red snapper, Atlantic menhaden), species identification, and tracking reef fish in underwater survey videos. Fish age is the fundamental parameter used for estimating growth, longevity, mortality, maturity, and reproductive output of specific species stock, while species counts provide estimates of abundance and diversity. All of this information gets feds into stock assessment models to enable science-based fisheries management. These automations have been developed by academic partners at the University of Washington and Mississippi State University in collaboration with SEFSC staff, with the goal of increasing the Center’s capacity to process data and the efficiency with which the Center is able to fulfill its mission of providing the scientific advice and data needed to effectively manage the living marine resources of the Southeast Region and Atlantic High Seas.\n\nConference Proceedings\n\nSimegnew Yihunie Alaba, Jack H.

    "text": "Photo by Cristian Palmer on Unsplash.\n\n\n\nOcean thermodynamic structure (temperature, salinity, and density versus depth) is very challenging to measure continuously all throughout the world’s ocean. Ships are slow and expensive, human scientists get tired and sea sick, and the ocean is, well, rather large. Several thousand autonomous Argo profiling floats deployed all over the world since the late 1990s have provided unparalleled glimpses below the surface into the deep ocean. Yet compared to the size of the ocean, even these data remain sparse.\nOn the other hand, satellites orbiting the planet several times a day are able to measure properties such as ocean temperature in considerably higher spatial and temporal resolution. But satellites are optical instruments, meaning they can only “see” as far down into the water column as light can penetrate. In most of the ocean, this is not very far – a few meters at best, as shown in the photo above. The average depth of the ocean, in contrast, is around 4 kilometers or 4000 meters.\nThe goal of this project was to develop a way of predicting sparsely sampled subsurface structure using higher resolution satellite data.\n\nPosters and Presentations\n\nGrossi, M.D., E.F.
