##### Greetings!

I am a **data scientist** with the [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/){target="_blank"} [Southeast Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southeast-fisheries-science-center){target="_blank"} (SEFSC) having joined [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/){target="_blank"} in 2021 after more than a decade in academia conducting and supporting oceanographic research. I oversee multidisciplinary teams of marine and computer scientists developing innovative artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models for automating assorted SEFSC mission priorities including [species identification and tracking](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/increasing-efficiency-video-surveys-artificial-intelligence){target="_blank"}, [fish aging](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/scientists-identify-more-efficient-means-determine-age-fish-using-ai-and-near-infrared){target="_blank"}, and marine mammal detection from aerial drones.

I also facilitate cloud migration, transition planning, and data curation and governance initiatives for the SEFSC and represent NOAA Fisheries in the NOAA Artificial Intelligence Working Group. As a strong proponent of FAIR data principles (**f**indable, **a**ccessible, **i**nteroperable, **r**eusable) and [open science](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/science-data/open-science-noaa-fisheries){target="_blank"}, I serve on the SEFSC regional data governance team and participated in the 2024 [NMFS OpenScapes Mentor](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/){target="_blank"} program.

<!-- My first programming language is **R**, but nowadays I gravitate to **Python** due to its widespread popularity within the ML community. If a task seems automatable, I like to find a way. I prefer **LaTeX** over common word processing software any day. After years of using **Jupyter Notebooks** for writing Python code and documentating workflows, I was recently introduced to **Quarto**, which is quickly becoming my go-to publishing system. -->

A longer autobiographical narrative, for the inquisitive mind, can be perused [here](bio.qmd).
